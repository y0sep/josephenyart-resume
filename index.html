        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am Joseph Enyart! I am a first year student that attends the University of California, Riverside. Originally from Garden Grove in Orange County, I currently now dorm on campus so I do not have to commute for an hour each time I come to school for class. Majoring in Psychology, my goal is to eventually become a therapist who specializes in helping individuals with trauma and/or depression. To do so, I need to successfully graduate from UCR while balancing a strong GPA along with many extra curriculars that make my resume stronger, in hopes of getting into a graduate school. The minimum requirement and qualities to become a therapist include a master's degree so I will have to attend graduate school if I want to continue pursuing my career of being a therapist.
 <br><br>

        In the past, I worked two jobs during high school. The first job was at a Vietnamese fast food fusion chain restaurant. I worked there around the time of peak covid towards the end of my sophomore and beginning of my junior year. Maintaining this job for around 8 months, I gained a lot of experience during this job, learning how to deal with customers, work with co workers despite a language barrier, and manage a POS system while memorizing numerous menu orders to ensure the most satisfaction for our customers. While I enjoyed this job, I ended up leaving the job towards the time of college apps because I needed time to focus more on my college applications, as they would determine the next four years of my life. Henceforth, I quit the job at Nguyen's Kitchen and worked on my college applications, putting my best effort and energy into them.<br><br>

       Finally the time of college apps ended in which I wanted to get another job because I had much more free time on my hands. Wanting to get more experience at a different job, I strayed away from reapplying to my old job and instead looking for a new job. I found a job and applied, making it to the interview stage. From here, I also passed the interview stage and I was accepted at a Japanese restaurant, Wa Sushi Teriyaki, to serve as mainly a waiter. At this job, I had the memorize the whole menu including different types of sushi rolls, different types of bento combos, and the numerous drinks that were served in order to ensure the happiness of the customers that we served. Furthermore, I had to re-learn a new POS system in order to take over the front desk in order to substitute for some workers incase they were not able to make it some days. This job was different from my last job because it was more so focused on being a waiter instead of mainly working as a cashier/cook. However, I did enjoy this job more because it was easier to get along with the customers so I felt like the time went by quicker.
